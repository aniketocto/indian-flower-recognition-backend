# 🌸 Flower Recognition System (AI + Grad-CAM)

An end-to-end **flower image recognition system** built using **PyTorch**, **FastAPI**, and a lightweight **HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend**. The project focuses on **learning-first ML engineering**, GPU utilization, explainable AI (Grad-CAM), and clean deployment architecture.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end **flower image recognition system** built using **PyTorch**, **FastAPI**, and a lightweight **HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend**.

The current version of the system supports classification of **37 curated flower classes**, providing:
- Predicted flower name
- Scientific name
- Prediction confidence
- Explainable AI visualization using Grad-CAM

The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing additional flower classes to be added in future iterations.

The system is split into:

* **Frontend** (static, cloud-deployable)
* **Backend** (FastAPI + PyTorch, local GPU-powered)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a complete ML pipeline from scratch
* Learn GPU-based training & inference
* Implement explainable AI using Grad-CAM
* Create a clean, interactive frontend
* Deploy using a realistic, industry-style architecture

## 📦 Model & Dataset Files

Due to size constraints, trained model weights and datasets are not included in this repository.

- Model files (.pth) can be generated by running the training scripts
- Datasets should be placed inside the `data/` directory

This approach keeps the repository lightweight and reproducible.

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

### 1️⃣ Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
cd ml-gpu-project
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2️⃣ Start Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Check:

* API Docs: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
* Health: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/health](http://127.0.0.1:8000/health)

### 3️⃣ Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 5500
```

Open:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5500
```

## 🌍 Deployment Strategy (PATH A)

### Frontend

* Hosted on **Vercel** (static hosting)

### Backend

* Runs locally on GPU machine
* Frontend communicates via REST API using local IP

This approach:

* Avoids cloud GPU costs
* Is perfect for demos, viva, and learning
* Follows real-world frontend/backend separation

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* GPU compatibility is critical before ML work
* Grad-CAM greatly improves model trust
* ML projects benefit massively from good documentation
* Separating frontend & backend simplifies deployment

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Cloud GPU deployment (AWS / GCP)
* Dockerization of backend
* Authentication & rate limiting
* Advanced Grad-CAM visualizations
* Mobile-friendly UI
